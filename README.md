# HTML Learning Exercises
A collection of my HTML learning milestones as I progress toward web development and Web3 skills.

## About
This repository contains a series of HTML exercises I completed while learning the basics of web development. Each exercise focuses on a specific HTML concept, helping me build a strong foundation for creating web pages and eventually transitioning to Web3 development (like building dApps).

## Exercises
- `Latihan 1/latihan_0.html`: Basic HTML structure and tags.
- `Latihan 2/latihan_1.html`: Using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- `Latihan 3/angkot2.js`: A simple JavaScript file (possibly a mistake in HTML exercises, might be moved later).
- `Latihan 3/paragraph.html`: Adding paragraphs (`<p>`) and basic text formatting.
- `Latihan 4/heading.html`: More practice with headings and styling.
- `Latihan 5/list.html`: Creating ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists.
- `Latihan 6/hyperlink.html`: Adding hyperlinks (`<a>`) to navigate between pages.
- `Latihan 6/hyperlink2.html`: Exploring relative and absolute links.
- `Latihan 7/admih_hyperlink.html`: Hyperlinks with images (`<img>`).
- `Latihan 7/image.html`: Embedding images in HTML.
- `Latihan 8/mommy.jpg`: Adding an image file (likely used in `image.html`).
- `Latihan 8/tabel.html`: Creating tables (`<table>`) for structured data.
- `Latihan 8/tabel_merging.html`: Merging table cells with `rowspan` and `colspan`.
- `Latihan 9/form.html`: Building a basic form (`<form>`) with input fields.
- `Latihan 9/latihan_combo.html`: Combining multiple HTML elements (lists, tables, forms) in one page.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cahyoromadhon/html-learning-exercises.git`
2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `Latihan 1`).
3. Open the `.html` file (e.g., `latihan_0.html`) in a web browser to see the result.

## Technologies
- HTML (primary focus)

## Status
This is an ongoing learning project. More exercises will be added as I continue my journey toward web and Web3 development.
